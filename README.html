>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>Given the popularity of various byte-sized data types in C-based languages, databases, and computers in general, there&#39;s a need for validating those data types in Perl &#38; Moo(se). This module covers the gamut of the various number and character types in all of those forms.</p>

<p>The number types will validate that the number falls within the right bit length, that unsigned numbers do not go below zero, and &#34;Perl unsafe&#34; numbers are using either Math::Big* or bignum/bigfloat. (Whether a number is &#34;Perl safe&#34; depends on your Perl&#39;s <code><a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/Config.html#ivsize|ivsize" class="podlinkurl"
>http://perldoc.perl.org/Config.html#ivsize|ivsize</a></code>, or data from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Data%3A%3AFloat" class="podlinkpod"
>Data::Float</a>.) Big numbers are also checked to make sure they have an accuracy that supports the right number of significant decimal digits. (However, BigInt/Float defaults to 40 digits, which is above the 34 digits for 128-bit numbers, so you should be safe.)</p>

<p>Char types will validate that it&#39;s a single character, using Perl&#39;s Unicode-complaint <code>length</code> function. The bit check types (all of them other than <code>WChar</code>) will also check that the ASCII/Unicode code (<code>ord</code>) is the right bit length.</p>

<p>IEEE 754 decimal floating types are also available, which are floats that use a base-10 mantissa. And the SQL Server &#34;money&#34; types, which are basically decimal numbers stored as integers.</p>

<h1><a class='u'
name="TYPES"
>TYPES</a></h1>

<p>All available types (including lots of aliases) are listed below:</p>

<pre>   ### Integers ###
             [SIGNED]                                   | [UNSIGNED]
     4-bit = SNibble SSemiOctet Int4 Signed4            | Nibble SemiOctet UInt4 Unsigned4
     8-bit = SByte SOctet TinyInt Int8 Signed8          | Byte Octet UnsignedTinyInt UInt8 Unsigned8
    16-bit = Short SmallInt Int16 Signed16              | UShort UnsignedSmallInt UInt16 Unsigned16
    24-bit = MediumInt Int24 Signed24                   | UnsignedMediumInt UInt24 Unsigned24
    32-bit = Int Int32 Signed32                         | UInt UnsignedInt UInt32 Unsigned32
    64-bit = Long LongLong BigInt Int64 Signed64        | ULong ULongLong UnsignedBigInt UInt64 Unsigned64
   128-bit = SOctaWord SDoubleQuadWord Int128 Signed128 | OctaWord DoubleQuadWord UInt128 Unsigned128

   ### Floats (binary) ###
   (Total, Exponent) bits; Significand precision = Total - Exponent - 1 (sign bit)
   
   ( 16,  4) bits = ShortFloat
   ( 16,  5) bits = Half Float16 Binary16
   ( 32,  8) bits = Single Real Float Float32 Binary32
   ( 40,  8) bits = ExtendedSingle Float40
   ( 64, 11) bits = Double Float64 Binary64
   ( 80, 15) bits = ExtendedDouble Float80 
   (104,  8) bits = Decimal    # not a IEEE 754 decimal, but C#&#39;s bizarre &#34;128-bit&#34; float
   (128, 15) bits = Quadruple Quad Float128 Binary128

   ### Floats (decimal) ###
   (Digits, Exponent Max)
   
   ( 32,  8) = Decimal32
   ( 64, 11) = Decimal64
   (128, 15) = Decimal128
   
   ### &#34;Money&#34; ###
   (Bits, Scale)
   
   ( 32,  4) = SmallMoney
   ( 64,  4) = Money Currency
   (128,  6) = BigMoney  # doesn&#39;t exist; might change if it does suddenly exists
   
   ### Chars ###
   WChar = Single character (with Perl&#39;s natural Unicode-compliance)
   Bit check types = Char/Char8, Char16, Char32, Char48, Char64</pre>

<h1><a class='u'
name="EXPORTER_TAGS"
>EXPORTER TAGS</a></h1>

<p>Since there are so many different aliases in this module, using <code>:all</code> (while available) probably isn&#39;t a good idea. So, there are some Exporter tags available, grouped by language:</p>

<pre>   # NOTE: Some extra types are included to fill in the gaps for signed vs. unsigned and
   # byte vs. char.
   
   :c       = Char Byte Short UShort Int UInt Long ULong Float Double ExtendedDouble
   :stdint  = Int4 UInt4 ... Int128 UInt128 (except 24-bit)
   :c#      = SByte Byte Char16 Short UShort Int UInt Long ULong Float Double Decimal
   :ieee754 = Binary16,32,64,128 and Decimal32,64,128
   :tsql    = TinyInt SmallInt Int BigInt SmallMoney Money Float64 Real
   :mysql   = TinyInt SmallInt MediumInt Int BigInt (and Unsigned versions) Float Double
   :ansisql = SmallInt Int Float Real Double
   
   :is_*    = All of the is_* functions for that tag
   :*+is    = Both the Moo and is_* functions for that tag</pre>

<h1><a class='u'
name="CAVEATS"
>CAVEATS</a></h1>

<p>The <code>Int</code> type is also used by <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MooX%3A%3ATypes%3A%3AMooseLike%3A%3ABase" class="podlinkpod"
>MooX::Types::MooseLike::Base</a>, and is even used (but not exported) as a subtype for the Integer classes. So be careful not to import both of them at the same time, as they have different meanings.</p>

<p>Most C-based languages use a <code>char</code> type to indicate both an 8-bit number and a single character, as all strings in those languages are represented as a series of character codes. Perl, as a dynamic language, has a single scalar to represent both strings and numbers. Thus, to separate the validation of the two, the term <code>Byte</code> or <code>Octet</code> means the numeric 8-bit types, and the term <code>Char</code> means the single character string types.</p>

<p>The term <code>long</code> in C/C++ is ambiguous depending on the bits of the OS: 32-bits for 32-bit OSs and 64-bits for 64-bit OSs. Since the 64-bit version makes more sense (ie: <code>short &#60; int &#60; long</code>), that is the designation chosen. To avoid confusion, you can just use <code>LongLong</code> and <code>ULongLong</code>.</p>

<p>The confusion is even worse for float types, with the <code>long</code> modifier sometimes meaning absolutely nothing in certain hardware platforms. <code>Long</code> isn&#39;t even used in this module for those types, in favor of IEEE 754&#39;s &#34;Extended&#34; keyword.</p>

<p>The floats will support infinity and NaN, since C floats support this. This may not be desirable, so you might want to subtype the float and test for Inf/NaN if you don&#39;t want these. Furthermore, the &#34;Perl safe&#34; scalar tests for floats include checks to make sure it supports Inf/NaN. However, the odds of it NOT supporting those (since Perl should be using IEEE 754 floats for NV) are practically zero.</p>

<p>Hopefully, I&#39;ve covered all possible types of floats found in the wild. If not, let me know and I&#39;ll add it in. (For that matter, let me know if I&#39;m missing <i>any</i> type found in the wild.)</p>
